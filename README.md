# Stock Prediction AI

Stock Prediction AI is a proof-of-concept program designed to demonstrate that the stock market is not entirely unpredictable. This program downloads stock data for specified stocks and uses machine learning to predict the stock's performance (in terms of percentage change) for the next day. It employs seven different AI models to provide insights and validate predictions.
