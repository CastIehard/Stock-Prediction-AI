# Papers
During my Bachelor's degree, I authored two papers on predicting the stock market using machine learning, with the first written in 2023 in English and the second in 2024 in German.

## First Paper
This paper discusses the initial data collection using a Raspberry Pi, crucial for real-time financial data acquisition. Data will accumulate over five months, providing six months' worth of training data (180 data points). This data will undergo analysis to produce a detailed CSV file. Linear interpolation will address data gaps, and daily news evaluation using FinBERT will generate topic scores. Financial ratios derived from this data will train an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network, setting the stage for predictive models on stock price movements at various intervals. The process includes a review of over 15 sources, laying a solid foundation for further exploration.

## Second Paper
This paper successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict stock price changes, specifically using Adobe Inc. as a case study. By systematically collecting and analyzing data, and implementing various machine learning models with optimized hyperparameters, an effective method for generating trading signals was developed. Models were carefully selected and evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R2 Score. The use of RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization and Optuna to determine optimal thresholds for trading signals proved practical and efficient. The best-performing model was Linear Regression, achieving an overall score of 4.78. The defined thresholds for buy and sell decisions led to a portfolio value of 1156.76 C, a significant increase of 33.93% compared to the hold strategy. Future research could expand in several directions to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions. First, integrating additional data sources such as social media could provide a more comprehensive market perspective. Second, developing a dynamic adjustment of model parameters in real-time would be a valuable enhancement for quick response to market changes. Finally, implementing and backtesting the developed trading signals on historical data could help validate their practical applicability and robustness.
